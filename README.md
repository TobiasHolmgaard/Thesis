This is code from data processing for my thesis with the name: "Atmospheric modes of variability as driver for European drought conditions", submittet on the 5th of March 2024.

The main part is made by the scripts "spi_PC_correlation_extended_season_and_SPI_loop.py", "SPI_vs_PAR" and "Morans_I.py". The script "SPI_cor_shifted_periods.py" is modified for making cross-seasonal PC and SPI correlations, where the loop is making it for the current timesteps.

The code is made for running through a lot of data and producing plots to generate an overview and afterward being interpreted.

Data used is mainly from Copernicus Climate Data Store, where E-OBS has been used for SPI calculations and ERA5 data for EOF analysis.
